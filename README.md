## Problem

Clinics and doctors across Africa often lose track of patient follow-ups due to poor communication systems.  
Patients forget, never get notified, or lack access to digital platforms, especially in under-resourced communities.

---

## Solution

RemindHealth enables clinics and doctors to:
- Enter patient name, contact info, and appointment date
- Use AI to generate a personalized reminder message
- Send the message via SMS, WhatsApp, or Email — no apps required
- Track sent reminders and ensure better patient outcomes

---

##  Built With

- **Claude.ai** – AI prompt engineering for message generation
- **Bolt.new / MGX** – Frontend UI mockups
- **GitHub** – For documentation and sharing

---

## AI Prompt Sample
Write a warm, friendly SMS reminder under 320 characters for a patient named Fatou, reminding her of an appointment with Dr. Diallo on May 27 at 3PM at the Dakar Clinic.

**Output:**
> Hello Fatou! This is a reminder of your follow-up with Dr. Diallo at Dakar Clinic on Monday, May 27 at 3PM. We look forward to seeing you soon. Stay safe!
